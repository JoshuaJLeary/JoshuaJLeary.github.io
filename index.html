                <p>
                Presently, I work for Johnson Brothers Liquor Company as a Sales Representative. I have gained vast knowledge about the products, industry and the market demand while having the opportunity to apply my skills to
                accelerate on-going sales processes while in the field. Although I have enjoyed my time at Johnson Brothers I do not see a future with the company and have decided to change my career path to one with a much brighter future with Prime Digital Academy.</p>
